# BoggleSolver
## Introduction to Boggle
The classic game *Boggle* is a fun word challenge that has players around a small box with a 4x4 grid of letter dice.
Before starting each round, you roll the dice to change the letters. Then each player tries to spell out as many
words as they can using letters that are adjacent (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) to a letter.

You have three minutes to find as many words possible! Once time runs out, each player compares their list and if anyone
has one of your words you both cross it out. In the end, you should be left with a few original words that no player
found. Count up the letters and you have your total points for the round!

Here is an example of a player finding the word 'tea' and 'heat'

## BoggleSolver
The purpose of the BoggleSolver is to brute force every possible location on the board and compare it to a dictionary.
Essentially, the program finds every possible word combination on the board! This is quite powerful, so make sure you
don't let anyone know you're using this to cheat.

The program supports generating and solving its own board, letting you input a custom board, and you playing against
the computer.

<br>**Note:** the BoggleSolver is still being created and has not been released yet. It should be completed soon!
